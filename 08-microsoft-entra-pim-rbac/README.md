# Lab: Baseline Identity Hardening with Microsoft Entra Security Defaults(GTG)

## Objective
Implement baseline Zero Trust security policies on a Microsoft Entra ID free tenant to enforce mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) and block legacy authentication protocols.

## Why Security Defaults
On a free Microsoft Entra ID tenant, advanced identity tools like Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and custom Conditional Access Policies aren't available — they require an Entra ID P1/P2 or Entra Suite license. Security Defaults was the right architectural call within that constraint:

- **Zero cost, zero setup friction** — works instantly on free developer/test tenants, no sandbox workarounds needed
- **Core protection baseline** — enforces MFA via Microsoft Authenticator for every account, standard users and admins alike
- **Protocol hardening** — automatically blocks legacy sign-in methods (POP3, IMAP, SMTP basic auth) that attackers routinely target for credential harvesting
- **Pragmatic engineering** — shows the ability to lock down an environment with built-in controls when enterprise-tier tools aren't on the table

## Execution
1. Navigated to Microsoft Entra ID → Properties in the Azure portal
2. Located Security Defaults and enabled the tenant-wide protection baseline
3. Confirmed global enforcement — every account in the directory, standard and admin, now required to register for and use MFA at sign-in

## Validation
- ✅ Tenant properties dashboard confirms the organization is protected by Security Defaults
- ✅ Legacy authentication protocols fully blocked across the directory
